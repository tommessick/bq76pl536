The file bqdevice is a copy of the /dev/bq76pl536 device.  You can read
from it and it will produce the same data as the actual device.

The file dumpbq reads from standard input and prints formatted text
showing the data from the driver.

Here is an example:

cat bqdevice | ./dumpbq.pl
2.98 3.00 3.00 3.00 3.00 3.00 3.00 3.00 3.00 3.00
3.00 3.00 2.96 2.96 2.96 2.96 2.96 2.96
